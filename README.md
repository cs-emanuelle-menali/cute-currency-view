currency view with sweet animation on start :)

I had to write this for a project and thought to open source it. This is a way more optmized version and I'm still
adjusting some stuff I'm not publishing it for now. But it is in the works!

### Supported attributes:
  - text
  - hint
  - textColor
  - textColorHint
  - textSize
  - autoStart (default is true)

### What still needs to be done:
  - Decide if releasing with some Currency Formatter or leave this up to user
  - Input Filtering
  - Performance Investigation (check for memory leaks or too much allocation)
  - Public/Private API changes

Again, this a very early preview and feedback is extremely helpful.
